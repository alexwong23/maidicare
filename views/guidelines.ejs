				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When and how do the employer make salary payments to the helper?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The employer should pay the helper her salary monthly and no later than 7 days after the last day of salary period. We highly advise that employer does not hold the helper's salary for safekeeping purposes as this might lead to potential misunderstandings.</p>
					<p>There are 2 ways to make salary payments. The first way is to deposit to the helper's bank account in Singapore and let the helper keep the bank book. The second way is to pay via cash. If payment is via cash, we have prepared a salary schedule to ensure that there are proper records being done.</p>

			<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Most helpers are able to work without off-days in lieu of compensation. If the employer or the helper wants an off-day, it can be arranged prior to the maid's deployment. For usage of hand phones, it is up to the employer's discretion on the helper's usage on the hand phone.</p>

			<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the current monthly levy for the helper?</a>
			<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Levy is a pricing mechanism set by the government to regulate the amount of foreign workers in Singapore. The employers are required to pay the monthly levy for the helper. Currently, levy is at $265 (normal) and $60 (concession). The employer is entitled to a concessionary rate if there are eligible for the Young children/grandchild Scheme, Aged person scheme or the Persons with disabilities Scheme.
